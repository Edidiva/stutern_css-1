        <p><b>CSS</b></p>
        <p> <i>CSS</i> means cascading style sheets, it is a language that is used to sytle the HTML elements. This week, I learnt about the CSS box model, which are the content box and border box styling models. The content-box is the default setting for styling which impacts it's width and height on a element by only considering the dimension of the content alone while border box, considers the dimensions of the padding and border of a content and fits this into the width of the element. </p>

        <p><b>Margins, Borders, Padding</b></p>
        <p>These are all box properties,<i>Margin</i> is property is used to create space around the element ie., around the border area. <i>Border</i> This property is used to cover the content & any padding, & also allows to set the style, color, and width of the border. <i>Padding</i> This property is used to create space around the element, inside any defined border.</p>
